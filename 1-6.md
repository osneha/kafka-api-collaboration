# Part 6 - Explore


## 6.1 What's in the .gitignore?  What is this used for? 

Ans: A .gitignore file is a text file that tells Git which files or folders to ignore in a project. For example, putting ".logs" in the .gitignore will prevent generated log files from being pushed into a project.


## 6.2 Review the pom.xml file.  Did the video help explain the pom.xml?  What questions do you have? Post them to the discussion forum.

Ans: POM is an acronym for Project Object Model. The pom. xml file contains information of project and configuration information for the maven to build the project such as dependencies, build directory, source directory, test source directory, plugin, goals etc. Maven reads the pom. xml file, then executes the goal. The video posted on the website clearly explained pom.xml. I don't have any further questions regarding this.


## 6.3 Where is the Java source code? (Hint: refer to the Maven standard file structure above).


Ans: The java source code is in java directory under src and main directories( src/main/java)

Reviewed the above draft:
Java source code is in the src directory.Inside the src directory we have main and test folder.Within the main and test folders we put all the application sourcefiles.
They are shown as 
src/main/java
src/test/java



## 6.4 Explore the simple code. You can ignore the partition code (or explore it, too if you like!) 

Ans:The simple folder has classes like consumer, producer, producerHello, producerSentence, producerRandom java files in which we can write the logic of sending and receiving messages from producer to consumer and can write any logic to display messages on consumer. If you write any thing on producer, it will display in consumer.   


## 6.5 How many simple consumer apps are there?

Ans: One, which can be found under: kafka-api\src\main\java\com\spnotes\kafka\simple


## 6.6 How many simple producer apps are there?
Ans: Four, all found under "src/main/java/com/spnotes/kafka/partition".


## 6.7 What is the name of each application class?  (Hint: one is Consumer)

Ans: 
Draft 6.7:
Consumer
Producer
ProducerHello
ProducerSentence
ProducerSentenceRandom

Review:
The application class names are Consumer, Producer, ProducerHello, ProducerSentence, ProducerSentenceRandom.


## 6.8 What is the fully qualified name for each application class? (Hint: one is com.spnotes.kafka.simple.Consumer)

Ans:
The fully qualified name for each application class are 

com.spnotes.kafka.simple.Producer

com.spnotes.kafka.simple.ProducerHello

com.spnotes.kafka.simple.ProducerSentence

com.spnotes.kafka.simple.ProducerSentenceRandom

com.spnotes.kafka.simple - represents the namespace/package name of the project.

draft:
I reviewed all the answers and seems they all are correct.

The fully qualified name for each application class are 

com.spnotes.kafka.simple.Producer

com.spnotes.kafka.simple.ProducerHello

com.spnotes.kafka.simple.ProducerSentence

com.spnotes.kafka.simple.ProducerSentenceRandom

com.spnotes.kafka.simple - represents the namespace/package name of the project.


## 6.9 Where does Java code begin execution? (Hint: public static void main()). 

Ans:  Java execution begins from the main method. If the class that contains the main method has static members that need to be initialized or a static code block, this will be executed before the main method.

Start method of java program:

public static void main(String[] args){
    ...
}
Draft:
Java execution begins from the main method. If the class that contains the main method has static members that need to be initialized or a static code block, this will be executed before the main method.

Start method of java program:

public static void main(String[] args){
    ...
}
Review:
Execution always starts from main method in java programming language so that it begins excution from main method and it will be initialized.


## 6.10 Find the main() method for each application.  What else is in the class?

Ans:
In the class Customconsumer contains the following 
   - Main method.
   - Class ConsumerThread which contains
   - run() method
   - getKafkaCustomer() method.    
In the class customProducer contains
   - Main method
   - The other methods are getTwitterinstance


## 6.11 What dependencies are imported? What organization wrote each class you import?

Ans: The dependencies imported are present in the POM file.The dependencies are kafka,slf4j-api,slf4j-log4j12,log4j-core,twitter4j-core.The organizations are Apache Kafka,Simple Logging Facade for Java,twitter,Apache Logging services. 
Imported dependecies are present in POM file which are kafka-clients, slf4j, slf4j-log4j12, log4j-core, twitter4j and also have plugins in it. Organisations are kafka, slg4j, apache.logging, twitter4j
